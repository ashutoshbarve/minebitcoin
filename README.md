we have 3 functions to solve problem.
1. askiitoHex:
  it will convert your text to hex and pass O/p to other funcion.
2. Get-sha
   it will convert our hex text to SHA256.
   so basically we will be finding nonce which will give us sha which starts with required 0.
3. Get-mine
  so here we will be finding the value to nonce.
  basically, we will be finding nonce which will give us sha which starts with required number of 0's at prefix.
